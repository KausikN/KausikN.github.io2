<!–-break-–>
I was born, brought up, studied and basically did everything i did in my life here in Chennai. I studied in Sri Sankara Senior Secondary School from 1st all the way through 12th standard. In my 11th and 12th days, i developed a huge interest in coding and i was adamant that i would only pursue Computer Science in college. Fortunately for me, i got a sufficient rank in JEE Mains to get into IIITDM Kancheepuram.
