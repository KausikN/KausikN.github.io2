I was born, brought up, studied and basically did everything here in <b><i>Chennai</i></b>.
<!–-break-–>
I studied in Sri Sankara Senior Secondary School from 1st all the way through 12th standard. In my 11th and 12th days, i developed a huge interest in coding and i was adamant that i would only pursue <i>Computer Science</i> in college. Fortunately for me, i got a sufficient rank in JEE Mains to get into IIITDM Kancheepuram.
